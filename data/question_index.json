In part (b), many candidates used the CAS calculator to determine an expression for the first derivative. Some did not use a test (second derivative or sign test) to show that $r = 9.4$ gives maximum unused space. Some answers were not given to the nearest millimetre as required. Quite a few ignored including $r = 0$ as one of the two answers when $V'(r) = 0$. Part (c) was done poorly. Calculating the volume of unused space, spherical decoration and cylinder were not done well. Some used the idea of stacking the spherical balls upwards and sideways to determine the maximum possible number to fill the cylinder which was unsuccessful.

    "examinerComment": "Question 8 attempted by 4045 candidates    Mean 5.20/(7)    Max 7    Min 0\nPart (a) was done well with correct probability expressions stated. A common error was to determine $P(X \\geq 68) = 0.0548$. Part (b) was generally done well, although some candidates treated the data as being discrete. Candidates mostly recognised the restricted domain for jumbo eggs and the conditional probability. Some rounded values to three decimal places in intermediate steps, and thus the final answer was not as accurate e.g. $\\frac{0.079}{0.081} = 0.975$ as opposed to $\\frac{0.0794}{0.0808} = 0.9827$ or $\\frac{0.0794067612}{0.08075665923} = 0.98328475$. Candidates should use the values from their calculator to perform subsequent calculations. A few incorrect responses included values greater than one (which should have signalled an error), and only stating the numerator of $P(67 < X < 75) = 0.0794$. Surprisingly, part (c) which was a standard inverse normal distribution question, was not done well. A common error of not expressing 0.05% correctly as a decimal, led to many incorrect answers of 68.25, 79.45, 72.88, 43.55. There were, however, successful responses where some candidates calculated the $z$ score and then determined the $x$ value using $z = \\frac{x - 60}{5}$. Unfortunately, a mean of 67 was used by some, and those that misinterpreted the question found the maximum weight of the lightest 0.05% of eggs.",

Hence, candidates could get incorrect answers in earlier parts of the question, but still get later parts correct (or vice versa). This question was a good example of all the different aspects candidates need to know for this topic. Accuracy was poor from some candidates, who did not give answers correct to four decimal places (or at least three). In addition, poor setting out, without clearly stating the mean and variance/standard deviation, was a problem for some candidates. Part (a) was generally done well, with even those who getting the wrong final answer knowing which $n$ and $p$ to use. In part (b), some candidates seemed confused about what the question was asking. Quite a few thought the distribution was binomial rather than normal. Those candidates who got part (b) wrong generally failed to receive any marks for part (c), as most did not write down the mean or variance being used, or used a binomial distribution. Parts (d) and (e) were generally done well. In part (f), the majority of candidates were awarded two marks for their calculations. However, many did not refer to the 'overlap' of confidence intervals, instead stating that one confidence interval was smaller than the other. In part (g), no marks were awarded to candidates only stating an 'increase', without providing a reasonable explanation. Many seemed to have the correct idea, but communication was poor. Quite a few candidates had some good ideas for part (h), especially in terms of independence and whether the probability would remain constant.

Some candidates split the integral, which was unnecessary. There were some excellent logical and sequential steps shown, while others just simply concluded the correct integral as the given area expression using technology. As it was a 'show that' question, all steps should have been shown clearly, with care given when writing the definite integral, ensuring that the lower and upper limits, '$dx$' were included and the integral was mathematically correct. Integrating the function $R(q)$ with respect to $x$, or $R(x)$ with respect to $q$ e.g. incorrect integrals such as $\\int_{0}^{q} 10\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right) + p \\, dq$, $\\int_{0}^{q} 10\\sin\\left(\\frac{q}{15}\\right) + p \\, dx$, $\\int_{0}^{q} 10\\sin\\left(\\frac{q}{15}\\right) + p \\, dq$, $\\int 10\\sin\\left(\\frac{q}{15}\\right) + p$, were common. There was a lot of 'fudging' to get to the required expression. Some candidates used technology without success, giving them unusual expressions for the derivative. Part (b) was answered reasonably well. Most candidates had the correct expression for the derivative, $q$ value of ~ 247, and stated the maximum area, but some did not use a test (second derivative or sign diagram) to show that the point was a global maximum, which meant they could not receive full marks. Incorrect values for $q$ and the area occurred when candidates' CAS calculators were in degree mode rather than radian mode, a common error that needs practice with students. Stating the maximum area was frequently omitted. Part (c)(i) was well done. Some odd answers expressing $R'(x)$ in terms of $q$ were $R'(x) = \\frac{2}{3}\\cos\\left(\\frac{q}{15}\\right)$ or $R'(x) = \\frac{3}{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)$ or $R'(x) = \\frac{2}{3}\\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{15}\\right)$. Part (c)(ii) was generally done poorly. Commonly, EH was not determined accurately using CAS, the total length of fencing was not attempted or incorrectly calculated, the total length of fencing excluded a side length. Many calculations were performed on CAS in degree mode rather than in radian mode, and candidates incorrectly thought that GH = FE = $p$.",

    "examinerComment": "Question 3 attempted by 4025 candidates    Mean 3.49/(7)    Max 7    Min 0\nThis question was done reasonably well, although many numerical errors were made in performing calculations. A lack of understanding prevented candidates from obtaining appropriate linear equations. However, some excellent answers demonstrated a thorough understanding of stationary points and their conditions. Interpreting the point of inflection at $x = 0$ from the diagram was difficult for some i.e. $f''(x) = 6ax + 2b$ results in the equation $0 = 6a(0) + 2b$ and hence $0 = 0 + 2b$. Many did not conclude that $b = 0$, leaving this as $6ax + 2b = 0$, followed by $a = -\\frac{2b}{6x}$ or $x = -\\frac{2b}{6a}$, or did not substitute $x = 0$. Some candidates did not realise that there was a turning point at $x = 1$, (given in the question) i.e. $f'(1) = 0$. Candidates were able to correctly find an equation using $\\int_{0}^{1} x^3 - 3x + 2 dx = \\frac{3}{2}$, but made errors in simplifying the algebraic equation involving fractions. Some candidates did not identify that $f(1) = 0$. A common error was candidates using $\\int_{0}^{1} f'(x) dx = \\frac{3}{2}$.",

A common error was providing a second $x$-intercept with $x = \\ln 0$, or not stating the coordinates (as required) of the $x$-intercept as $(\\ln 4, 0)$. In addition, some candidates incorrectly stated that when $e^x = 0$, $x = 0$. Part (b) was generally answered well. However, some candidates did not determine the first derivative or factorise $2e^{2x} - 4e^x$ correctly. Furthermore, important steps were frequently omitted e.g. in calculating $f(\\ln 2)$, candidates did not show that $e^{2\\ln 2} = e^{\\ln 4} = 4$ or $-4e^{\\ln 2} = -4 \\times 2 = -8$, or went straight from the first line to the required value e.g. $2e^{2x} - 4e^x = 0$, $x = \\ln 2$ or $f(\\ln 2) = -4$. A common mistake was to write that $e^x . e^x = e^{x^2}$. It was pleasing to see most candidates knew that $e^{\\ln 2} = 2$. In part (c), some candidates could not determine the second derivative correctly or erred in simple factorisation such as $4e^{2x} - 4e^x = 0, \\Rightarrow 4e^x (e^x - 4) = 0$. Numerous candidates did not identify that $\\ln(1) = 0$, and erred with arithmetic evaluation such as $e^{2\\ln 1} - 4e^{\\ln 1} = 2 - 4 = -2$. Common mistakes included stating that if $e^x = 1$ then $x = 1$, $e^2 = 2$, $e^4 = 4$, and $f''(x) = 4xe^{2x} - 4xe^x$. Part (d) was done poorly. Candidates were able to plot the intercepts and point of inflection correctly, but did not label these as required in the question. Generally, candidates were able to recognise the limiting behaviour of $y$ as $x \\to -\\infty$, $y \\to 0$, except for some who drew horizontal asymptotes such as $y = -1$ or $y = -2$. A number of candidates plotted the points from the given table of values. There were some graphs that were drawn very neatly, and with all the featured points labelled clearly.",

In part (b), most candidates were able to identify sources of bias, but the explanations often lacked essential detail and/or lacked logical flow. In order to explain a source of sampling bias, it must be explained how a sub-group of the population is likely to be either under-represented or over-represented in a sample because of that particular bias source. Simply saying, for example, 'the sample was taken between 9 am and 10 am and so does not represent the entire population' is not an explanation. An example of a solid explanation was 'the sample was taken between 9 am and 10 am which means that people who work in 9 to 5 jobs are less likely to be selected in the sample' as it explained how the bias was introduced. Issues such as 'leading questions' were not sources of sampling bias, but a source of bias in the study design. Sample bias related solely to the process of selecting a sample. Part (c) was answered well with a clear use of formula. Part (d) was answered well with a good use of the calculator to convert the z-score to a confidence percentage.",

In part (a), many candidates either appeared to not understand how to use the graph to answer the question, or did not use a ruler to achieve reasonable accuracy. Part (b) was a straightforward linear equation question, however, many candidates seemed confused by the logs. Candidates generally underperformed in part (c), with many unable to apply log laws to derive the required format. Overall, part (d) was handled well with follow-through from part (c).",
